# :purple_circle: *Vi√±a - your vinotheque* :purple_circle:

Have you ever found yourself standing in front of the overwhelming wine cupboard in a supermarket, not knowing what to buy? Me: Yes! And my friends too. I was imagining how great it would be to have an app that serves as both my private wine library and a platform for showcasing.

## Objective

- Hands-on learning by building an interactive, data-based web app
- Learning usage of Agile Methodology using Gibhub Projects, working with their [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/zabokaa/projects/3/views/2) + labels plus milestones for [Issues](https://github.com/zabokaa/vina/issues). It will be very valuable when working in a team in the future.
- To offer a help for users to decide which bottle of wine to buy
- Creating a platform for wine lovers to share their recomendations as well as their experiences

## Design

### Colors

The primary color, wine red, immediately conjures associations with red wine. To introduce a fresh contrast, I incorporated a light yet robust blue tone, reminiscent of the open skies often associated with vineyards. This combination captures both the depth of wine culture and the natural beauty of vineyard landscapes, creating a visually engaging experience for users.

### Logo

   ![logo](./static/img/vinalogo.png)

The goal was for the logo to be both classic and hipster-modern, aiming to appeal to a wide range of age groups. Various age target groups should feel equally addressed. Additionally, the logo should not distract from the content. Therefore, it is kept monochromatic, in the secondary color.

## Testing

[HERE](./testing.md) are my steps of manually testing all User Stories. Since this project is relatively small and not too complex, manual testing is more efficient. Furthermore, I can check for UX.

### Official Validators

- W3C HTML Validator [HERE](./assets/imgreadme/htmlchecker.png): No errors
- W3C CSS Validator [HERE](./assets/imgreadme/jigsaw.png.png):  No errors
- CI Python Linter [HERE](./assets/imgreadme/pylinter.png):  Some lines too long error -> formated code -> No errors
- Lighthouse Chrome DevTools [HERE](./assets/img/lighthouse.png)
Have been sucessfully tested for all pages, just displaying 1 example for each validator.

### Bugs

#### Solved

- Comments couldn't be saved due to the status field not accepting input. This was resolved by replacing the CharField with the correct IntegerField.
- Alert was missing for users when they entered no age and pressed the submit button. This has been rectified.
- When a non-logged-in user clicked the like button, they were correctly redirected to the login form. However, after submission, there was no correct redirection. This issue has been fixed by updating the return HttpResponseRedirect.
- The navbar toggle icon was not visible. This was addressed with a workaround using CSS.
- Previously, uploaded user images were not displayed. This was fixed by setting enctype="multipart/form-data" in the form, allowing file uploads to function correctly. Oooh yess!

#### Unsolved

- Currently, users can bypass the age verification process by directly accessing /blog or /vinoteka URLs in the browser. While users can input a false age, it's challenging to enforce strict control over this aspect. The age verification serves as more of a soft barrier, reminding users rather than providing foolproof age verification.
- Date validation for new diary entry is working with default build in validation, but not on the ../movieteka site. For now user will be redirected to an unstyled site where the error is indicated and can be changed.

## Deployment

  From How to Start a Django Project till Access to your Deployed Site:

1. **Start a Django Project:**
   Open your terminal (I am working wiht VS Code) and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. Run the command `django-admin startproject your_project_name`.

2. **Create a New Django App:**
   Navigate into your new project directory with `cd your_project_name` and run the command `python manage.py startapp your_app_name`.

3. **Create a Model:**
   In your new app directory, open the `models.py` file and define your model classes.

4. **Create a View:**
   In the same app directory, open the `views.py` file and define your view functions or classes.

5. **Update URLs:**
   Update the `urls.py` files in your project and app directories to route to your new views.

6. **Run Migrations:**
   Run `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate` to create and apply migrations for your new models.

7. **Test Your App Locally:**
   Run `python manage.py runserver` to start the development server and access your app in your web browser.

8. **Login to Heroku:**
   Run `heroku login` and enter your Heroku credentials.

9. **Create a New Heroku App:**
   Navigate to Heroku and click on "New" > "Create new app". Enter the app name (e.g., "goodfood"), and click "Create app".

10. **Update Settings:**
    Update your `settings.py` file to be compatible with Heroku. This includes setting `DEBUG` to `False` (always before deploying with Heroku!), adding your Heroku app URL to `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, and configuring your database to use Neon Postgres.

11. **Back to Heroku Configure Environment Variables:**
   Navigate to "Settings" > "Config Vars" and click "Reveal Config Vars". Add a new variables with the keys for `SECRET_KEY`, for connecting to Database `DATABASE_URL`, and for storaging media files in a cloud aswell `CLOUDINARY_URL`

12. **Connect with GitHub:**
   Navigate to the "Deploy" section, connect with GitHub, and choose your repository name.

13. **Choose Deployment Method:**
   Decide if you want to deploy manually or enable automatic deployment after every commit to GitHub.

14. **Access Your Deployed Site:**
   Once done, your application will be live. Yippie!

15. **Access Your Deployed Site:**
    Once the build is successful, you can access your deployed site using the URL provided by Heroku.

16. **Clone and Install Dependencies:**
   If you want to clone this repository, you can easily install all necessary versions and libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

üç∑ Cheers !!
