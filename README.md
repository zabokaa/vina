- Moving to one answer box, the color of that box will change, as well as the cursor.
- After choosing one answer, the "More Info" as well as the "Next" button will pop up.
- There is no go home etc. button becuase I like the user to finish the quiz.
- The user knows where they are in the quiz: The questions are numbered.

### Footer

  ![footer](./assets/img/footer.png)

- The footer contains a short impressum and my email address in case the user wants to contact me.

## Design

### Colors

As primary and secondary colors, I chose purple and green (here with a more bluish tone) because they are two colors globally connected to feminist movements.

  ![colorpalatte](./assets/img/ColorPalate.png)

For indicating the correct and incorrect answer of each questions I use green and red because the colors are self-explanatory in this context. I chose a pastel colour in each case because it is easier to integrate into the colour palette of the page.

### Typography

I did research about feminist typography and picked two fonts out of those suggestions. The font used for the headline is reminiscent of historical typefaces and therefore fits well for a quiz on the history of feminist achievements in Germany.

## Testing

### Manual

- Navigation is working.
- After entering a username, the user can press the "Start the Quiz" button.
- The intro section will not be displayed while showing the quiz section.
- If a username has been entered, it is stored for the next round.
- "Next" and "Modal" buttons are only displayed after the user has selected an answer.
- The user can only select one answer.
- The "Modal" button ("More Info") can be closed manually, and if the user did not, it will close when displaying the next question.
- Questions are picked randomly for each new round.

### Official Validators

- [W3C HTML Validator](./assets/img/htmlVal.png): No errors
- [W3C CSS Validator](./assets/img/CSSvalidator.png):  No errors
- [Lighthouse Chrome DevTools](./assets/img/lighthouseVal.png): Accessibility 100
- [WAVE](./assets/img/WAVEval.png): No errors for accessibility and color contrast

### Bugs

- When a user wants to restart the game the shuffle funcion was not called. I fixed the bug by moving `randomize(questions);` to the `openQuiz()` function.

- When user did not close the modal box it has been displayed (beiing open) on the next slide. I fixed it using following if-statment `if (modal.style.display === "block") {
        modal.style.display = "none";
    }`
