# :purple_circle: *Vi√±a - your vinotheque* :purple_circle:

Have you ever found yourself standing in front of the overwhelming wine cupboard in a supermarket, not knowing what to buy? Me: Yes! And my friends too. I was imagining how great it would be to have an app that serves as both my private wine library and a platform for showcasing.

ERD had been created with Djangoviz: [PublicLink](https://gh.atlasgo.cloud/explore/ad1d21c7)

## Design

### Colors

The primary color, wine red, immediately conjures associations with red wine. To introduce a fresh contrast, I incorporated a light yet robust blue tone, reminiscent of the open skies often associated with vineyards. This combination captures both the depth of wine culture and the natural beauty of vineyard landscapes, creating a visually engaging experience for users.

## Testing

### Manual

### Official Validators

- [W3C HTML Validator](./assets/img/htmlVal.png): No errors
- [W3C CSS Validator](./assets/img/CSSvalidator.png):  No errors
- [Lighthouse Chrome DevTools](./assets/img/lighthouseVal.png): Accessibility 100
- [WAVE](./assets/img/WAVEval.png): No errors for accessibility and color contrast

### Automated

### Bugs

#### Solved

- Comments couldn't be saved due to the status field not accepting input. This was resolved by replacing the CharField with the correct IntegerField.
- Alert was missing for users when they entered no age and pressed the submit button. This has been rectified.
- When a non-logged-in user clicked the like button, they were correctly redirected to the login form. However, after submission, there was no correct redirection. This issue has been fixed by updating the return HttpResponseRedirect.
- The navbar toggle icon was not visible. This was addressed with a workaround using CSS.
- Previously, uploaded user images were not displayed. This was fixed by setting enctype="multipart/form-data" in the form, allowing file uploads to function correctly. Oooh yess!

#### Unsolved

- Currently, users can bypass the age verification process by directly accessing /blog or /vinoteka URLs in the browser. While users can input a false age, it's challenging to enforce strict control over this aspect. The age verification serves as more of a soft barrier, reminding users rather than providing foolproof age verification.
- Date validation for new diary entry is working with default build in validation, but not on the ../movieteka site. For now user will be redirected to an unstyled site where the error is indicated and can be changed.
