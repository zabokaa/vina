# :purple_circle: *Vi√±a - your vinotheque* :purple_circle:

Have you ever found yourself standing in front of the overwhelming wine cupboard in a supermarket, not knowing what to buy? Me: Yes! And my friends too. I was imagining how great it would be to have an app that serves as both my private wine library and a platform for showcasing.
